# Related works
Other names for "silhouette extraction" that I use to find related works are:
* Silhouette Detection
* Human Segmentation
* Silhouette Segmentation
* Semantic Segmentation (not restricted to humans but general object labeling in scenes)
* Pedestrian detection

  Pedestrian detection is a different use case but has the same requirement:  
  Detecting silhouettes in real-time

There are several different approaches to silhouette extraction and they use different kind of hardware configuration. So far I found:
* Silhouette from accurate depth data (Kinect)
* Silhouette from static single color image
* Silhouette from static stereo color image
* Silhouette from moving stereo color image

I am mostly interested in either static single color image or static stereo color image because that is what the PS4 camera supports.
